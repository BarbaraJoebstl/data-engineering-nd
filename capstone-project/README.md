Data Engineering Capstone Project

This is the capstone project of the udacity nanodegree for data engineering. 
The aim of the project is to apply learned skills during the course. This project will show how to load and transform data from four different data sources, load the data in spark apply quality checks and store the data into a star schema so that it can be used for BI apps and ad hoc analysis.

The project is developed in 5 steps:

Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
Step 3: Define the Data Model
Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

All steps and links to the needed files can be found in `Capstone_Project.ipynb`
