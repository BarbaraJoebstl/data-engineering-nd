(To be fair, the &quot;other&quot; side&#x27;s banned books are usually what these people liked a generation earlier; although there are truly banned books, that, for example, cannot be sold on Amazon, and they are usually, but by no means always, more obviously offensive and of more questionable worth.)<p>What you will <i>not</i> find on banned book lists, with few exceptions, is the books that were used to teach the humanities for hundreds, sometimes even thousands of years, up through the first half of the 20th century. Increasingly, you won&#x27;t find them in the library, either. They haven&#x27;t been &quot;banned&quot;, though. They&#x27;re just being &quot;curated&quot; out of collections and pulped.

Why listen to vinyl when your digital download doesn&#x27;t require unnecessary space for storage, and has the ability to skip between albums and tracks instantly? Why use Twitter with a very limited set of characters and features? Twitter existing did not kill long-form writing? Gemini existing will not kill the web somehow? Why the hostility? There is room enough for all the mediums. And they each have their place in our culture.

darkwater,30113039,30112126.0,"&gt; Many of my older extended family members have a single email account shared by a husband and wife. Or in one case the way to email my aunt is to send an email to an account operated by a daughter in a different town. Aunt and daughter are both signed in so the daughter can help with attachments or “emails that go missing”, etc.<p>As usual with the &quot;personas&quot; scenarios, people creates their unrealistic scenario (just like when talking about UX or design). These personas you are describing will probably fall back to low-tech methods in most of the cases, they won&#x27;t fail to take a plane because GMail locked them out due to unusual activity when they are trying to show the ticket QR in the airport. They will just print it (or have someone print it for them) beforehand.<p>&gt; The seaman in this scenario has a smartphone with the email signed in. It’s also signed in on the family computer at home. Both the wife and him send email from it. Maybe a kid does to from a tablet. This isn’t that difficult.<p>You just missed to add that they use their shared email to communicate between them by using the &quot;Sent&quot; folder.

davide_v,30113008,30111408.0,"You are absolutely right, I tested in on myself over several years. I want to share my story so far.
Since I got a prescription of -4 I was so mad that I didn&#x27;t want to wear those glasses. Furthermore I really felt like they were too &quot;strong&quot; for me. So I kept wearing the previous one that was at -3. Since then my myopia never got worse.
But I wanted to go further and try to reverse it in some way. I have read many studies, like the one you mentioned about the animals with glasses&#x2F;contact lenses that after some time develops myopia. That is the real proof that &quot;too strong&quot; glasses causes myopia. But what does &quot;too strong&quot; mean? It actually means 2 cases: the glasses that are actually stronger that the one you need (like -4 if you have -3.75), or the glasses that are used when you don&#x27;t need them (short distance). In both cases you are slowly increasing your myopia (like the animal study). So to stop the myopia you just need to use the &quot;right&quot; correction for the &quot;right&quot; time. For example at PC you don&#x27;t need full correction (for low myopia you don&#x27;t even need glasses at all), because full correction is only for driving and looking at infinite distance. So the first thing to do, if you work at PC, is to buy less strong glasses (even super cheap one you can find on Amazon). What less strong means? It depends on your myopia and your distance from the screen. But you can calculate it using a ruler that has the diopters written on it (just print it: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endmyopia.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;myopia-ruler.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endmyopia.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;myopia-rule...</a>). For example I&#x27;ve -3.5 but at PC I wear -1.5 because my screen is 70cm far.
As other mentioned already, the best correction you need to use is the one that blurs the text a little bit, where you are still able to read but is not crystal clear.
You may notice that this gets even harder if you have different myopia per eye, because one eye may blur, but not the other or viceversa (I still don&#x27;t know what happens here, if it&#x27;s better to cover 1 eye or not, etc).
Btw, if you combine: less strong glasses at PC, regular intervals looking way far, no glasses for reading&#x2F;phone, you will surely stop the myopia, and maybe you even improve. After years I just improved from -4 to -3.25, but it&#x27;s better than nothing (and I was not so constant)...

jillesvangurp,30112965,30111516.0,"This is a classic mistake that relatively junior people make. There&#x27;s a body of research out there that goes back more than half a century that gives you plenty of heuristics, metrics, and other ways to classify code as good at bad in all sorts of interesting ways. Most engineers have barely any awareness of this and instead absorb vague notions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; things from others over time.<p>Junior frontend engineers coming fresh out of college are typically very ignorant on this front. Ignorant as in they have yet to rediscover this wealth of information through reading books, articles, etc. As well as by messing up a few code bases or by absorbing it from their more senior peers through e.g. code reviews or venting on blogs, twitter, and whatnot. That is because this stuff just isn&#x27;t taught in a lot of places. Or if it is taught at all, it isn&#x27;t taught very well typically by people who don&#x27;t do a lot of coding. I know, because I used to be such a person before I switched to doing some actual software engineering 20+ years ago.<p>Combined with the arrogance of youth and the tendency to label everyone above 27 as a senior, unclean code is rather common. And even acknowledging it is bad is a problem when you lack the intellectual tools to reason about code quality.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of taste to consider high coupling and low cohesiveness a bad thing. It&#x27;s easy to see when that is out of wack (long list of imports, 4000 line source files, etc.). It&#x27;s easy to measure as well if you care too but typically redundant to do so. Likewise, having a high level of indirection would be a violation of e.g. Demeter&#x27;s law. Likewise deep inheritance hierarchies aren&#x27;t great (just don&#x27;t). And that is equally easy to observe. Finally having a large function with insane nesting of loops, ifs, and what not produces a high complexity that you can measure or just look at it an go &quot;gee, this looks rather complicated&quot;. It&#x27;s not that hard to spot bad code if you know what to look for. It&#x27;s also not that hard to improve such code once you understand why it is bad.<p>Every bad code base you&#x27;ve ever seen probably has a lot of things that you can objectively point at and say this just isn&#x27;t very clean because X. It stops being a matter of esthetics when you phrase it like that. And the broken windows theory combined with a level of ignorance&#x2F;indifference usually leads to more bad code making it into the code base.<p>There are plenty of studies that will suggest that having a lot of hard to read code does not help maintainability, extensibility, and a few other -ilities. Those are called quality attributes. And yes, you trade them off sometimes. There are yet more studies that point to maintenance as a dominant thing in overall software cost. There are also several standards that have lots of things to say about quality attributes. People developing e.g. embedded software for cars or medical devices tend to take that stuff rather seriously.<p>But understanding that high cost is bad is relatively uncontroversial. Producing code that isn&#x27;t very clean leads to higher cost. It&#x27;s not about the esthetics but about cost. Both current and future.<p>Sometimes you can trade that cost off. E.g. if you are going to throw away your UI code in 6 months, it&#x27;s OK to put a few cheap fresh out of college people on that project. It&#x27;s going to be a dumpster fire in terms of code quality but it might be useful as an MVP and you&#x27;ll replace it anyway before it gets out of hand. I make tradeoffs like that all the time. And I also use such projects as an opportunity to train up young people quickly. Let them make a few mistakes and then show them how to fix it.",1643366346,comment,,,,,,,

Schroedingers2c,30112887,30112653.0,"You can think of scenarios in which any classical state (i.e. the shared state is completely specified by the local states of the two kids) does the task with some success probability that is upper bounded, say by 75%. And you can even include some unspecified hidden variable in your classical state and could even allow the two kids to share some classical randomness (think: each of them has a button that returns the same random number for both kids). This hidden variable could be anything (a single unknown property, a whole collection of unknown properties or whatever really) and represents possibly incomplete knowledge, for example due to imperfect microscopes or equipment. Since you don&#x27;t specify what this hidden variable is, it encapsulates anything that is allowed by classical physics (remember we started out with a classical state).<p>Now lets allow entangled states between the kids (states that can only be specified if you have both subsystems, locally if you measured such a state your result will look at least a bit random or even completely random). Then you can prove that the two kids can do the task (that has classical success probability 75%) with success probability ~85% all of a sudden.<p>You can write down general inequalities that describe such behaviour and that&#x27;s what Bell inequalities are. The fact that entangled states in quantum mechanics violate the classical bound (which you cannot break if you demand your two kids can only share states allowed by classical physics, even if you allow unspecified hidden variables), proves that nature is not classical. It doesn&#x27;t prove that nature <i>is</i> quantum, it just proves that nature <i>is not</i> classical. Bell inequalities have also been unambiguously experimentally verified [1].<p>In conclusion, nature allows for two-party (or multi-party) states that cannot be described by just describing the local parts of it. There is no information in the local parts, but if you look at both parts together then there is information. Think &quot;the whole is more than the sum of its parts&quot;. Classically, the whole <i>is</i> the sum of its parts. Classically, you read a book page by page. If your pages are entangled with each other, you could only read your book by looking at all pages together, because if you looked a single pages separately anything written there would look like random garbage to you.<p>The question that remains is: Where is the information then, physically? In some sense you could say it does not exist before measurement, because only when you look at the correlations between the local measurement results of the two kids will you find out that the underlying state must have been entangled (which you get to know if the state violates a Bell inequality). But that is just one possible interpretation, there still is a lot of scientific debate about what quantum mechanics really means.<p>These are exactly the scenarios that make quantum so weird but fascinating at the same time.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature15759"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature15759</a>",1643365715,comment,[30113011],,,,,,

simonh,30112823,30111258.0,"I see the relationship of determinism to free will completely differently. Without determinism there is no agency. If my state - my memories, preferences, experiences, skills, personality and emotions do not determine my actions, how can those actions be truly mine?<p>I know many people are very uncomfortable with this, but I don&#x27;t really know what they actually want. I think appealing to QM to wave an indeterminism wand and &#x27;somehow&#x27; resolve the problem is wishful thinking. Randomness, as pointed out by others here, is no answer and if all QM contributes is randomness then it&#x27;s no real help. I&#x27;m perfectly willing to accept that there&#x27;s a certain degree of randomness in our choices, that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not the answer to the question of free will.<p>I also don&#x27;t see how appeals to some non-material source of decisions helps either, surely such a source must also have a state? It&#x27;s simply punts the question, and I see no reason to suppose it actually helps answer it. Aside from the fact that if a &#x27;non-material&#x27; source of choices interacts with real matter, surely that makes it real, right? It&#x27;s just nonsense on stilts.<p>IMHO we are real, material beings. Our state determines our actions, with some randomness sprinkled in, and I&#x27;m fine with that. Yes this has some uncomfortable philosophical implications, but that&#x27;s ok. In fact I think it&#x27;s a good thing. If we&#x27;re all driven by our state, and that&#x27;s determined by factors outside our control, it humanises us. We&#x27;re flawed beings living in a dangerous universe. We need to stick together and learn to understand and tolerate our flaws and weaknesses. Coming to this realisation has changed my attitude to a lot of things, and to me that capacity for change is all the free will I need.",1643365080,comment,,,,,,,

Reporters (and of course the press release) seem allergic to addressing such questions.<p>If you read a story about biofuels and it has no mention of the price of the fuel, you can bet it&#x27;s pretty much a meaningless piece of news.  There is not a single $ sign in the story.<p>It always turns out the fuel costs like $25 per gallon to produce. The basic concept that you can make fuel from biomass is not challenging. And flying it in a plane&#x27;s gas tank is not new.

Then, on the receiving end of things, most of the criticism people who are expressing in this forum wrt to uncle bob, do so about examples where they coming from the perspective of something they understand.<p>I think there is A LOT of value in all of this experience, but it has 0 utility if you don&#x27;t understand it. In other words, you are much better off not considering how you <i>feel</i> about code at all, and always sticking to doing things because you understand why. (And I&#x27;d say &#x27;understand&#x27; means in a way that you can explain to someone else who may be skeptical). Context is key... so it&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re about to do a live coding demo in front of the board, then yeah, it&#x27;s ok to comment stuff out - I think that&#x27;s obvious. Ideally, your outcomes will be much, much better if they&#x27;re coming from those &#x27;obvious&#x27; points of view in any given situation.<p>Any just to be fair, doing something because you&#x27;re curious, or it&#x27;s fun, is just a good a reason as any, it just depends on the context.<p>This is why, there are other people who I&#x27;ve worked with, who know all that stuff - I&#x27;m talking super senior people - and yet rarely ever cite it or even mention it. Usually, they will ask questions because they&#x27;re patiently trying to get you (or whomever) to see for yourself the same, all-encompassing &#x27;obvious&#x27; reason, that overrides all the other important factors in a given context, that they already see. If you ask them why a piece of code that doesn&#x27;t &#x27;feel right&#x27; to you is the way it is, they&#x27;ll usually have a story about some situation, where they just had to do it that way, and maybe it&#x27;s bad now but if you were there, and knew what they knew, you would have probably done the same.<p>So, my point is, yes uncle bob stuff is fairly sound, but no I don&#x27;t agree that we should follow it if we don&#x27;t understand it and we&#x27;re better off almost always sticking to what we do understand. O but also cool analogy about the quick and dirty. I just realized though that if you invert it completely it&#x27;s like &#x27;<i>slow</i> and clean&#x27;.",1643364206,comment,,,,,,,

14,30112712,30105666.0,I am in healthcare and the leadership whoever that is makes me question continuing. Their decisions just don’t come with reason I am starting to question who is making such decisions. We are not supported and are left out to face the front lines with no sound decision making process behind what we do. If I come across a severely sick patient I am asked to wear a gown that covers 2&#x2F;3s of my front from my neck to my knees along with my basic medical mask and face shield. That is all the protection I get. My head nurses do not show up and test the clients for covid they just get deemed droplet precautions until they get better. If they are confirmed covid then we can get an N95 mask but no one is testing them unless they test their selves and all my clients are elderly so not going to be tested. Now 2 months after firing those who choose not to get vaccinated we are told we have to work even with covid if our symptoms are not serious. The lunacy I am seeing is highly turning me off from doing this forever. What if it was Ebola? There is no way I can trust my leadership to make the correct decisions to keep me safe. And I don’t have any authority to use resources or make change myself. It is very tiring to do this job day after day and with the housing market I can not even afford to get into a house. I love my job but am considering a change to get into something higher paying and worth my time.,1643364186,comment,,,,,,,

pure_simplicity,30112703,30111211.0,"What would be his ulterior motive? there&#x27;s no money in it for him; ivermectin is dirt cheap and he doesn&#x27;t produce it. If you think it is all reputational, then it would have been easier and better to salvage his reputation by just admitting his educated guess was wrong if it is in fact wrong, but more research was necessary to prove that. No one would fault him for that, and he knows that.<p>I think he is just sincerely convinced by the evidence and wants to help tackle the pandemic. He made multiple recommendations some of which got adopted as standard of care (ivermectin wasn&#x27;t adopted), before any good research was done, simply because that was the best that could be done in a new pandemic. He has got a pretty good track record, even discounting ivermectin<p>Then again, there are also studies designed to undermine the evidence for off label treatments, such as the one about HCQ that was retracted from the Lancet. So if you are gonna question people&#x27;s motives then at least  question both sides. resistance to ivermectin  may also be unscientific in nature.

rightbyte,30112699,30112403.0,"I agree with my whole heart.<p>I think you forgot one of the most devastating points in Clean Code, namely short functions and DRY (when overdoing it). It leads to the same problem &quot;jumping through 50 files&quot;.<p>My favorite subversive action to write clean code is using jumps. There is no end to how convoluted code people write to avoid the oh so harmful leap.<p>I feel like much of the need for short functions comes from nesting ifs moving to code more and more to the right. That is easily solved by jumps or early returns. Early returns can lead to too many functions if not doing with modesty, though.<p>EDIT:
Dogmas taking the developer out of his comfort zone is probably the main culprit. Any advice is good, as long as you don&#x27;t follow it.",1643364123,comment,"[30114910, 30114163]",,,,,,
